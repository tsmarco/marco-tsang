 Implement an API method to get groups of animals

npm test


Notes:
-JWT(JSON web token) was used as the token for authorization.
-MVC structure was used with the controller handling API responses
post routing.

 done in real scenarios.

 Known issues:
-Controller tests are broken as of a Supertest/ babel dependency issue.
